The precondition of a successful online business is following proper business architecture and automation, excellent UI - User Interface Design, UX - User Experience taken by statistically, and the most updated web trend that converts random traffic into a potential and effective consumer.

Proper markup writing is a must for better performance and scalability of the project. Maintain theming, and base layout so that I can reuse the markup for future projects.

For styling in CSS, I do maintain an advanced level of theming to reduce huge lines of code, shrink the file size, and reduce the time of execution which helps to get highly optimized results.
Deeply understandings of CSS3 2D & 3D animations, and diverse use of CSS3 variables to make a theming base stylesheet.

A clear understanding of JavaScript DOM, and a solid understanding of jQuery & jQuery UI library.

Extensive knowledge about business automation, and software architecture, several times work as a project manager and team leader. Deeply understanding of UI/UX, statistical designing factors, web trends for developing highly competitive web products, and startup business solutions. I've worked for Codecanyon.net, and Envato Marketplace.

I can take responsibility for my own personal development. I'm continually evaluating and upgrading my skills so that I can stay at the cutting edge of web design & development.
